# Basic Chat
I made a small chat app to learn WebSockets. It accepts messages from users and broadcasts them to all other users. It doesn't save history or anything though.

It uses Node.js with &micro;ws for the backend, and Vue on the frontend for displaying messages.

## Running it
- install &micro;ws with NPM
- install Vue into the res/ folder
- change the IP address of the WebSocket server in the frontend.js code
